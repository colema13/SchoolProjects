Link used to find out how to loop through c++ map: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26281979/how-do-you-loop-through-a-stdmap
The way I tested my code for through running it after I was finished and making sure certain inputs went through and others didn't. I also printed statements where I could like at the end of the program when freeing up the memory to make sure that the loop actually worked.
I am somewhat confident that the code works because all inputs give the results I want, however I am not getting the warning the lab said we should get, so I am not sure that the destructor is working with or without the virtual function.
The way I tested things was by dynamic cast worked and then writing the rest of the code. Then I tested the functionality of the entire prompt segment. I did this for the rest of the sections and then ran the whole thing.
I think my testing was sufficient because I went through all cases that a person could enter. So, I made sure that they were entering numbers where numbers should go and strings where strings should go.
One of my favorite parts of the lab was just getting to use new things like dynamic casting or looping through a map. It was very satisfying to have it work first try.
